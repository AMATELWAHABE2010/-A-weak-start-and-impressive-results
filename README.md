## 📅 Year 1 — Build a Strong Foundation in Python 🧰
**Goal:** Master programming logic and the essential math to move toward Data Science.

### 🔹 Module 1 — Core Python & Logic
1. Inputs, Outputs, and Data Types 📝  
   - Output: `print()` to display information.  
   - Input: `input()` to get user input.  
   - Types: String, Integer, Float.  
   - Type conversion: use `int()` and `float()` around `input()`.

2. Arithmetic Operations and Variables ➕➖  
   - Storage: naming rules and storing values in variables.  
   - Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, modulo `%`, exponentiation `**`.

3. Conditionals and Boolean Logic 🧠  
   - Control flow: `if`, `elif`, `else`.  
   - Boolean logic: `and`, `or`, `not`.

4. Loops and Loop Control 🔁  
   - Loops: `for` and `while`.  
   - Control: `break` and `continue`.

### 🔹 Module 2 — Functions & Data Structures 🧩
5. Functions and Using `return` 🔁  
   - Define functions with `def`. Use parameters and return values.

6. Lists and List Operations 📚  
   - Creation, indexing, `append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, comprehensions.

7. Dictionaries 🔑  
   - Key-value storage: add, modify, delete entries.

8. Tuples & Sets 🔒  
   - Tuples: immutable sequences.  
   - Sets: unique elements and set operations.

### 🔹 Module 3 — Math & Statistics Foundation 📐
R1. Linear algebra / slope review — linear equations `y = mx + b`.  
R2. Intro to calculus — derivatives as rate of change (intuition).  
R3. Descriptive statistics — mean, median, mode.  
R4. Dispersion — standard deviation.

### 🔹 Module 4 — Advanced Application & OOP ⚙️
9. Advanced Comprehensions — concise and powerful data transforms.  
10. Intro to OOP — classes, objects, simple organization.  
11. Error Handling & File I/O — `try`/`except`, read/write files.

## 📅 Year 2 — Data Handling and Modeling 📊
**Goal:** Work comfortably with larger datasets and core modeling tools.

### 🔸 Module 1 — Data Handling Tools
12. NumPy — arrays, vectorized ops, dimensions.  
13. Pandas (Part 1) — Series & DataFrame, read CSV/Excel.  
14. Pandas (Part 2) — clean data: NaNs, duplicates, types.  
15. Pandas (Part 3) — prepare data: filter, sort, `groupby`, `apply`.

### 🔸 Module 2 — Visualization & Analysis 📈
16. Matplotlib — line, bar, pie; labels & titles.  
17. Seaborn — scatter, heatmap, distributions, EDA.  
18. Applied stats — mean, median, std on datasets.

### 🔸 Module 3 — Modeling & Machine Learning 🧠
19. Intro to ML — supervised vs unsupervised; model lifecycle.  
20. Linear Regression — build predictive models with scikit-learn.  
21. Evaluation & Validation — MSE, R², train/test split, CV.  
22. Applied Project — full mini-project combining Year 2 skills.

**Goal:** Build advanced neural networks, apply to images/text, and finalize a professional portfolio.

### 🔺 Module 1 — Deep Learning & Neural Networks
23. Intro to DL — ML vs DL, nodes, layers, activation functions.  
24. Keras / TensorFlow Basics — install and build Sequential models.  
25. Build & Train ANNs — forward/backprop; binary classification.  
26. Optimizers & Losses — Adam, SGD, loss functions, validation.

### 🔺 Module 2 — Computer Vision 🖼️
27. CNNs — convolution, pooling, flattening.  
28. Image Classification — MNIST/CIFAR projects.  
29. Transfer Learning — fine-tune VGG/ResNet for tasks.

### 🔺 Module 3 — Natural Language Processing (NLP) ✍️
30. NLP Fundamentals — tokenization, stemming, lemmatization.  
31. Word Embeddings — intro to Word2Vec and vector representations.  
32. Sentiment Analysis — build a simple text classifier.

### 🔺 Module 4 — Professionalism & Deployment 💼
